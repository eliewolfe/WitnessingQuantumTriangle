    abstract={Bell's theorem in physics, as well as causal discovery in machine learning, both face the problem of deciding whether observed data is compatible with a presumed causal relationship between the variables (for example, a local hidden variable model). Traditionally, Bell inequalities have been used to describe the restrictions imposed by causal structures on marginal distributions. However, some structures give rise to non-convex constraints on the accessible data, and it has recently been noted that linear inequalities on the observable entropies capture these situations more naturally. In this paper, we show the versatility of the entropic approach by greatly expanding the set of scenarios for which entropic constraints are known. For the first time, we treat Bell scenarios involving multiple parties and multiple observables per party. Going beyond the usual Bell setup, we exhibit inequalities for scenarios with extra conditional independence assumptions, as well as a limited amount of shared randomness between the parties. Many of our results are based on a geometric observation: Bell polytopes for two-outcome measurements can be naturally imbedded into the convex cone of attainable marginal entropies. Thus, any entropic inequality can be translated into one valid for probabilities. In some situations the converse also holds, which provides us with a rich source of candidate entropic inequalities.}

    abstract={Bell's inequality fundamentally changed our understanding of quantum mechanics. Bell's insight that non-local correlations between quantum systems cannot be explained classically can be verified experimentally, and has numerous applications in modern quantum information. Today, the Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt (CHSH) inequality is probably the most well-known Bell inequality and it has given us a wealth of understanding in what differentiates the classical from the quantum world. Yet, there are certainly other means of quantifying ‘Bell non-locality without inequalities’ such as the famous Hardy's paradox. As such, one may wonder whether these are entirely different approaches to non-locality. For this anniversary issue, we unify the perspective of the CHSH inequality and Hardy’s paradox into one family of non-local games which include both as special cases. This article is part of a special issue of Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical devoted to ‘50 years of Bell’s theorem’.}
