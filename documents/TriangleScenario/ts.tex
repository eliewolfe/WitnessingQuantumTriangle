    \begin{abstract}
        Quantum correlations are often incompatible with a classical assumption of causal structure. This nonclassicality is often known as quantum nonlocality, and it is witnessed through the violation of causal compatability inequalities, such as Bell inequalities. Such inequalities were recently derived for the Triangle scenario [arXiv:1609.00672], begging the question: can these inequalities be violated by quantum correlations? Here we answer this affirmatively, and discuss specific Triangle scenario inequalities and quantum configurations which manifest nonclassical correlations. Numerical optimzations reveal quantum resources potentially qualitatively different from those known previously.
